# chessboard

- The finding_squares folder contains methods to find which square is which. 
- The model_training folder contains training code for the chessboard cropping algorithm using Yolov8
- The finished_training folder contains the trained chessboard cropping with weights for the Yolov8 Model
- roboflow_api contains the chessboard cropping algorith using the Roboflow's api 
- repostory for the training dataset for the chessboard cropping: https://universe.roboflow.com/steven-lt9bf/chessboard-segmentation


## Code that is mostly production ready
- go the final_algorithm and run Not-optiimized or Nvidia depending on if you have Nvidia GPU

## Recommendation on how to run on other machines:
- run the docker container (Requires Nidia GPU)
